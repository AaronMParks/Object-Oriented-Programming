Programs written in Java for OOP course at Texas State University.

Chatty Program :
    A GUI program that creates a chatroom between a certain number of users that allows them to communicate. Messages have been color coordinated for each user and a scroll bar has been added for convenience.

Game of Life:
    A Java program that simulates the "Game of Life" as as defined by John Conway:

    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Life Threads:
    A Java program that is essentially the same program as "Game of Life" except I have added additional lines to create a threaded program.
    The thread technique that has been used is "fixed size thread pooling". This provides performance increases over traditional threaded programs
      due to it having reduced the number of threads being created and utilized.

Unit Testing:
    This was an in class timed assignment. Given "this code" create unit tests around it to catch all possible run time errors.
